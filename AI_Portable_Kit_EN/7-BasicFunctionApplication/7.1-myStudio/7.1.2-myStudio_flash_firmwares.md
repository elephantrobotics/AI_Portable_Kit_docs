## 2.1 Burning the M5Stack-Basic Firmware

> **Note: Pi series robotic arms do not require burning the M5Stack-Basic firmware.**

Step 1: Connect to the PC. The M5Stack-Basic and PC connection diagram is shown below:

Step 3: Click Login -> M5Stack-basic to flash the required firmware:

> **Note:** The 280 PI/Jetson nano/Arduino version does not include M5Stack-basic, so "No Data" will be displayed after connecting to myStudio.
