# Color Recognition

After the system boots up, the program automatically launches. This program supports color recognition, shape recognition, feature point image recognition, AR QR code recognition, YOLOv5 image recognition, AiKit_UI, handle control, myCobot adaptive gripper examples, myCobot five-finger dexterous hand examples, and stag code tracking examples.

>>Note: The M5 version requires a device model selection before use; the PI version does not require one.
